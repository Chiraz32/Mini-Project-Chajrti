### Seller Role:
- **Catalog Management**: View their catalogue of plants.
- **Add Plants**: Ability to add new plants to the catalogue.
- **Order Management**: View orders, validate, or cancel them.

### Client Role:
- **Plant Exploration**: Browse the list of available plants.
- **Plant Details**: Access detailed information about each plant.
- **Favorites**: Mark plants as favorites and view the list of favorites.
- **Order Placement**: Place new orders for plants.
- **Order History**: Review past orders and their details.


This project aims to streamline the interaction between sellers and clients in managing plant-related activities through a user-friendly mobile application built on Flutter.
